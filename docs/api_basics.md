# API 

### What?
- API stands for Application Programming Interface, API is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software programs to talk to each other and share data or functionality.
- Application refers to any software with a distinct function. API architecture is usually explained in terms of client and server. The application sending the request is called the client, and the application sending the response is called the server.
- Interface can be thought of as a contract of service between two applications. This contract defines how the two communicate with each other using requests and responses.

### Why & Where?
- Promote business growth: Can be shared/exposed safely so that it can be integrated with other applications. Example - Marriot hotel booking can be integrated into many applications.
- Cross-platform communication: It is independent of client & server languages. Front-end/Client Angular/Typescript. Backend/Server - Java.

### Types of APIs

Dependending on the category, they can be different types.

#### Category I - Access
1. Public APIs
2. Private APIs
3. Partner APIs
4. Composite APIs

#### Category II - Communication
1. SOAP APIs - exchange messages using XML
2. REST APIs - The client sends requests to the server as data.
3. RPC APIs - exchange messages as function/procedure
4. Websocket APIs - exchange messages using JSON. 2-way communication. Connectivity establishes once and happens synchronously.
