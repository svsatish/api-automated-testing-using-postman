# API 

### What?
- API stands for Application Programming Interface, API is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software programs to talk to each other and share data or functionality.
- Application refers to any software with a distinct function. API architecture is usually explained in terms of client and server. The application sending the request is called the client, and the application sending the response is called the server.
- Interface can be thought of as a contract of service between two applications. This contract defines how the two communicate with each other using requests and responses.

### Why & Where?
- Promote business growth: Can be shared/exposed safely so that it can be integrated with other applications. Example - Marriot hotel booking can be integrated into many applications.
- Cross-platform communication: It is independent of client & server languages. Front-end/Client Angular/Typescript. Backend/Server - Java.
